HOW TO EXECUTE CODE:
A maze grid will be passed as an input to program in a 2D integer array form. 
Key: 
0= solid node ( closed) 
1= opened node
2= start node 
3 = goal node
Maze should look like: 
0 1 2 
0 0 1
3 1 1 
A 3 by 3 matrix for example. 
NOTE:  there should be space in between elements. 

On running program it will give a prompt to enter number of rows in maze, in given example number of rows should be 3 
so "3"  will be written and enter will be pressed. 
Then prompt for number of columns would be given and in given example's case 3 will be written. 
Then prompt to PASTE 2D ARRAY will appear  and then whole maze should be pasted. 
NOTE: if elements are entered 1 by 1,  program won't accept that. Whole array should be 
pasted and for this array could be written anywhere else and when program prompts 
whole array should be pasted in console.
A text file is also submitted along named "maze.txt" where a maze can be formatted appropriately and then 
can be pasted in console.
